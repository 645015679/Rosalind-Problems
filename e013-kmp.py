# Speeding Up Motif Finding
# =========================
# 
# A prefix of a string s having length n is a substring s[1:j]; a suffix of s is
# a substring s[k:n].
# 
# The failure array of s is an array P of length n for which P[k] is the length
# of the longest substring s[j:k] that is equal to some prefix s[1:kâˆ’j+1], where
# j cannot equal 1 (otherwise, P[k] would always equal k). By convention,
# P[1]=0.
# 
# Given: A DNA string s (of length at most 100 kbp).
# 
# Return: The failure array of s.
